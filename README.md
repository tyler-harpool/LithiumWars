## Basic Game Rules 📜

### Starting Setup 🛠️
Players start with the following:

1. **1 Base card**
2. **3 Worker cards**
3. **5 Basic unit cards**
4. **20 starting Primary Resources**
5. **5 starting Secondary Resources**

    title Card Distribution Per Deck
    "Common Cards" : 50
    "Uncommon Cards" : 25
    "Rare Cards" : 15
    "Special Cards" : 10
```


Let's design the core card structure:

Card Deck Composition (100 cards total):


50 Common Cards (50%)

Basic units
Basic resource generators
Common buildings


25 Uncommon Cards (25%)

Advanced units
Improved buildings
Basic upgrades


15 Rare Cards (15%)

Elite units
Special buildings
Advanced upgrades


10 Special Cards (10%)

Faction-unique units
Game-changing abilities
Supreme upgrades



Draw Mechanics:
markdownCopyStandard Draw:
- Draw 3 cards
- ~25% chance of drawing at least one Special/Rare card
- Individual draw probabilities:
  * Common: 50%
  * Uncommon: 25%
  * Rare: 15%
  * Special: 10%

Tech-Up Draw (Available once per 3 turns):
- Draw 2 cards
- Guaranteed at least Uncommon or better
- Higher chance for Rare/Special
To maintain the 25% chance for "good" cards while keeping the game balanced:

Card Quality Control:


Special cards are powerful but not game-breaking
All cards remain viable throughout the game
Common cards can combine for powerful effects


Resource Requirements:

markdownCopyCard Type | Primary Resource | Secondary Resource
---------|------------------|-------------------
Common   | 1-2              | 0-1
Uncommon | 2-3              | 1-2
Rare     | 3-4              | 2-3
Special  | 4-5              | 3-4

Balance Mechanics:


Higher-rarity cards require more setup
Common cards can counter special cards when played strategically
Resource investment scales with card power

Would you like me to:

Design specific card examples for each rarity
Create detailed probability tables for different draw scenarios
Develop the "Tech-Up" mechanic further
Design faction-specific card distribution variations


I'll develop the specific cards and their faction variations, plus expand on the Tech-Up system.
